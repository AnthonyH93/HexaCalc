## About
Three tabbed calculator for decimal, hexadecimal and binary for iOS built in Swift with Xcode. Provides numerous operations and seamless conversion between the three tabs.

With a seperate screen for each of the number systems users can focus on exactly what system they need - many of the apps currently on the app store with similar functionality have all three number systems on the same screen or they are severely outdated in terms of UI.

Switching tabs will result in instant conversion of the current value on the screen and will allow you to complete operations on that current number on the new screen.

For the hexadecimal and binary calculators there is a limit of 64 bits as they use integer conversion, however the decimal calculator will allow you to work with larger numbers even when the other two calculator screens show an error.

Tapping on the calculator output label causes the currently displayed number to be copied to your phone's clipboard. This works for any of the three tabs!

Note: All screenshots shown were taken on an iPhone X simulator.
